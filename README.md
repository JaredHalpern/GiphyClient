# GiphyClient
An iOS Client for Giphy! - Please note: only runs on iOS 8 at the moment.

To run:

1. `git clone` this repo.

2. `pod install` in the project directory.

3. Open the `GiphyClient.xcworkspace` file.

4. Build and Run.

5. Send dank memes.

**Note** - this was hacked together in a few days, as an experiment a year before I started working for GIPHY and knew anything about using the GIPHY API optimally. If you want to work with the GIPHY API, please feel free to reach out and you can do it properly. :)
